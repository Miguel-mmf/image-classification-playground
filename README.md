# **Image Classification Playground**
___

This repository is dedicated to studying and building an AI model capable of classifying images into 10 categories: 
```python
class NomesClasses(Enum):
    AIRPLANE = 'airplane'
    AUTOMOBILE = 'automobile'
    BIRD = 'bird'
    CAT = 'cat'
    DEER = 'deer'
    DOG = 'dog'
    FROG = 'frog'
    HORSE = 'horse'
    SHIP = 'ship'
    TRUCK = 'truck'
```
The main goal is to develop a robust image classification model using machine learning techniques and to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## **Features:**
- Development of image classification models using a machine learning algorithm
- Model evaluation
- Deployment of the classification model

## **Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using Poetry
3. Run the data preprocessing scripts
4. Train the classification models
5. Evaluate and select the best model
6. Deploy the model for making predictions

## **Requirements:**
- Python 3.10+
- UV
- TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
